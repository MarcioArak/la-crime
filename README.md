# Crime in Los Angeles Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Overview
This dataset was taken from the LAPD OpenData [crime dataset](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data). This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0°, 0°). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block in order to maintain privacy. This data is as accurate as the data in the database.

## Data Cleaning
I used Python for my data cleaning and modification which can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marcioarakaki/la-crime-cleaning-with-python). First thing I did was clean up the dates which had extra redundant information and formatted them for easier read. I prefer to use Python for data cleaning and Google Sheets for data inspection as it is easier to see faults in the data. 

## Data Visualization
For this dataset because it is so large and has many bits of information I thought it would be best to use a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marcio22/viz/CrimeinLosAngelesCA/Dashboard1) because it would be better to have active filters to find specific data.
